# Connect Four (Command line Version)

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the player first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc/circle from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizonta, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
